# Poll World
It's the [Django Polls tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/) with some nice frontend from Bootstrap and some HTMX for interactivity.

## How it works
You can create Questions which have Choices. These are then published to the index of the website. Each Choice starts with 0 votes, and users can vote on the Choices to increase the vote count.

## Details
The database is committed with this repo so somebody cloning it doesn't have to burden themselves with making some dummy questions/choices to try out the application.
